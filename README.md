# CORE for JS - write code close to how you think

## Write less, do more

This framework is the simple JS implementation of **CORE design pattern** (acronym: Contexts, Objects, Requests and Events)

This design pattern and the framework provide you ability to easily design and implement well structured, high cohesioned, and low coupled modular systems using Events and Requests. The benefit of that approach is a semantic which is highly close to Business Logic, which allows to write less code doing more, and have less bugs and debugging with it.

The ideas in the base of it are similar to following approaches, and it collects the best benefits of them:

- automata-based programming
- actor model
- system of signals and slots
- event-oriented programming

Event is a complex object, that means that something has already happend.

Request is a complex object, that means that something asks to perform its request.

Other objects of the system can subscribe to Events and Requests. Subscription is a static process (which is **different** to usual **obj.fire('event')** and **obj.on('event)** dynamic-style subscriptions).

During initialization CORE framework parses the code of methods and subscribes objects on Events and Requests statically.

Note that 99% of real-world cases don't need a dynamic behaviour, which is a good base to simplify this process

Static approach also offers you an ability to build a map how objects/methods are connected, and analyse it, which can extend your Static Code Analysis Tool benefits of your project.

## Events
### Description
There are three steps for using Events: initialization, firing, catching.

You can pass some data with Event.

### Example
#### Initialization
To initialize Event object call `Core.registerEventPoint` with Event name. Event name consists of Object name that has this Event and action name.
```javascript
  Core.registerEventPoint('Player_Started');
```

#### Firing
To fire Event call `FireEvent` function with created Event.
```javascript
  var Player = {
      mediaTag: document.getElementById('audio')

    , start: function() {
      this.mediaTag.play();
      
      FireEvent(new Player_Started({data: 'some-data'}));
    }
  }
```

#### Catching
The main twist is that you can catch the fired Event at any spaces of your code.

So this can cut your code several times.

Also you can dinamically subscribe to the event. It is useful in different cases, for example, in angular directives.

##### Single Event Catching
```javascript
var GoogleTrackingObject = {
  sendPlayerEvent: function() {
    var event = CatchEvent(Player_Started);
    
    /* event.data === 'some-data'  //true    */
    
    ga('send', 'event', 'player', 'start');
  }
}
```

##### Multiple Event Catching
```javascript
var GoogleTrackingObject = {
  sendPlayerEvents: function() {
    var event = CatchEvent(Player_Started, Player_Paused);
    
    ga('send', 'event', 'player', 'player_event', event.type);
  }
}
```

## Requests
### Description
There are three steps for using them: initialization, firing, catching.
You can pass some data with the Request.

### Example
#### Initialization
Just create Request object.
```javascript
  Core.registerRequestPoint('PlayerUI_StartRequest')
```

#### Firing
Fire it and ask something to perform your request.
```javascript
  var PlayerUi = {
    startPlaying: function() {
      FireRequest(
          new PlayerUI_StartRequest({data: 'some-data'})
        , function() {} // success callback
        , function() {} // error callback
        , {} // context
      )
    }
  }
```

#### Catching
Catch the Request and perform it.
```javascript
var PlayerAudio = {
  startPlaying: function() {
    var request = CatchRequest(PlayerUI_StartRequest);
    
    /* request.data === 'some-data'  //true    */
    
    return function(cb, eb) {
      /* start playing audio player logic */
      cb();
    }
  }
}
```

There can be several objects that can resolve Requests. When one of them can't process Request it call error callback function and next object start processing.

```javascript
var PlayerAudio = {
    mediaTag: null
  
  , startPlaying: function() {
    CatchRequest(PlayerUI_StartRequest);
    
    return function(cb, eb) {
      if( !PlayerAudio.mediaTag ) {
        return eb();
      }
      
      /* start playing audio player logic */
      cb();
    }
  }
}

var Player = {
  start: function() {
    CatchRequest(PlayerUI_StartRequest);
    
    return function(cb, eb) {
      /* start playing audio player logic */
      cb();
    }
  }
}
```

## States

It's an example how we can implement more complicated object's behaviour and use it in CORE-style.

### Description
#### Usage
```javascript
 Core.state(state1, state2, ...)
```

#### Params
```javascript
  (String) '' // name of the state
```

#### Returns
```javascript
 (Object) {
    value: (String)    // current state value
  , go   : (Function)  // method to change state
 }
```

### Examples
#### Initialization
```javascript
 var Object = {
   mainState: Core.state('Idle', 'Running', 'Stopped')
 }
```
When the object has been inited, its state goes to the first value of the set.


#### Changing State
```javascript
  Object.mainState.go('Running');
```

When state has been changed, the Event `Object.mainState.GoRunning` fires. And it can be catched at any space of the application.

```javascript
 var MiddleObject = {
  getState: function() {
    Core.CatchEvent(Object.mainState.GoRunning, Object.mainState.GoStopped);
    
    if( Object.mainState.value === 'Running' ) {
      // your code here
    }
  }
 }
```
